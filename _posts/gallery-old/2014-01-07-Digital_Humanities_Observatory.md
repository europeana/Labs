The Digital Humanities Observatory has extended its API implementation to harvest the Irish related Europeana 1914-1918 stories relating to Ireland, making them available on their portal and displaying them in their experimental 'Exhibit Visualizations'.

The organisation is a Europeana Network partner and was established under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy to manage and co-ordinate the increasingly complex e-resources created in the arts and humanities Their Europeana API implementation enriches search results on their website. It pulls in related Europeana content based on a mix of keywords in the item's metadata. Related content is then presented by subject, creator and location (based on the design of the Europeana portal).
