The Inventing Europe online platform is a pioneering collaboration between historians and cultural heritage institutions across Europe.

The platform explores the history of technology in Europe via curated tours and exhibitions. These virtual journeys are based on the objects and images of the partner heritage institutions and are enriched with relevant materials from Europeana collections through the Europeana API.

The Inventing Europe website currently offers 6 exhibitions and 34 tours. Each tour is a collection of 4 to 6 stories and outlines an aspect of the history of technology in Europe. The exhibitions group together a few tours around a specific technology theme, such as Daily Lives, Media & Communications, Knowledge Societies, Infrastructure, Globalisation & Governance.

Besides the 6 exhibitions curators from the partner institutions and other experts are invited to expand the contextual stories and contribute their perspectives in the form of new guest-curated tours.
