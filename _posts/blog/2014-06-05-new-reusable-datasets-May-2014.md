Each month sees a wealth of new and updated datasets added to Europeana. 

Continuing our focus on content that we think will be of particular interest for re-use, here are three notable new datasets added in May.

## Explore the latest datasets

In our [data section](/data/ "Europeana Labs Data") each featured dataset has a link to the main site (the Europeana Portal) where you can browse items, filter by your own terms, and follow links to the source material.

### Recent examples of re-usable datasets

## Datasets for API users

Within each of the [featured dataset entries](/data/ "Europeana Labs Datasets") on Europeana Labs there's a link to the API Console, a place to see how API calls are constructed and where you can play around with your own variants to extract custom data.

You'll also find more techniques in our documentation on [Querying Providers and Datasets using the Europeana API](/api/provider/)
