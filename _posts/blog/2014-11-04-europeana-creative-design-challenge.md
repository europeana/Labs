Europeana Creative is pleased to announce its final challenge encouraging you to design and submit products, applications and designs that reuse Europeana content in the theme of Design.

## The Design Challenge

The aim of the Europeana Creative Design Challenge is to engage designers, artists, developers and entrepreneurs to explore and experiment with with cultural heritage content available in Europeana.

We challenge ingenious minds and makers to rethink and redesign our common culture, and produce innovative and novel interpretations that make use of digital cultural content and data sourced from Europeana. The Europeana API allows you to access 2000+ collections and incorporate them into apps, games, products and websites. You can even create mash-ups when connecting Europeana's API with other sources or APIs. The possibilities are endless!

The challenge opened on the 30th October and online submissions are welcome until 15th January, 2015 at 20h00 CET via <http://ecreativedesign2015.istart.org/>

### What should you create?

We welcome a wide range of works for the Challenge, and appreciate contemporary and creative approaches to the digital cultural heritage materials. For example, including but not limited to results of digital fabrication, media art, design objects, web/mobile applications and services.

Please keep in mind that the submitted works must re-use materials that are sourced through Europeana. Please also check the license of the content, making sure that re-use for your project context is allowed. To make things easier, discoverherereusable content available in both the Europeana portal and API.

To give you some more concrete idea of works that could be made using the Europeana content, below are some examples. These are meant as examples only, so let your inspiration run free and propose new innovative ideas:

+ Make a fabric print using pictures from a museum
+ Create an installation using audiovisual media from archives
+ Program a piece that generates algorithmic music from old sound recordings
+ 3D print contemporary designs based on old objects
+ Design an app that remixes old paintings  

### Where to find content and inspiration?

In order to help inspire you Europeana Creative has developed a pilot application to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content and a little bit of imagination.

Culture Cam has been developed by partnersSpild af Tid&AIT - Austrian Institute of Technologyas the design theme pilot; a “live” digital similarity tool that takes you on a playful journey into the fascinating collections within Europeana by using your web camera. You can easily scan an object, and Culture Cam captures and analyzes it and comes up with search results of similar color, shape or pattern. This pilot is still in its demo phase so please watch this space for more information.

To discover further pilots that have been developed over the course of the project (in natural history and history education, social networks and tourism) clickhere. Ideas and examples of creative re-use are also available on the Europeana Creativeblog. Find out about our previous Challenge winners from the1stand2ndRounds.

Additionally, why not exploreEuropeana Labs? This platform sets out to provide everything needed to get started using the Europeana APIs to develop apps and re-use digitised cultural heritage objects. You can learn about the data, see what others have created and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects, which include books, art and artefacts, audio clips and more. To make things easier, discoverreusable contentavailable in both the Europeana portal and API.
