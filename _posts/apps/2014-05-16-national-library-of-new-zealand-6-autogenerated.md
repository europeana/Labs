The digital service of the National Library of New Zealand - Digital New Zealand (DigitalNZ) - uses the Europeana API (1.0) to harvest and locally store New Zealand-related Europeana records in their own aggregation.

Europeana objects are then searchable on their website (and via their API and widgets) with users re-directed to the Europeana portal when they click on an object in the search result. Through the mapping between the Europeana and DigitalNZ search facets, users can filter the Europeana content by usage rights (including finding CC-licensed content), by year and by media type using the standard DigitalNZ website facets. Read more about the collaboration with Europeana on their blog.
