euKindleSearch easily produces e-books for the Amazon Kindle based on searches in the Europeana collections. Winner in the category 'Greatest Commercial Potential' at Hack4Europe '11 - UK.

The prototype's first version allows users to search for item records from UK collections. Search results are shown in the Kindle Browser. Links display items in a separate page with a complete description. Further links lead to the data supplier. It is also possible to download search results as an e-book (mobipocket) either to PC or direct to Kindle.
