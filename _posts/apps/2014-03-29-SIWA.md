**SIWA: The EuropeanaConnect Service Integration Platform** - A framework to apply external services to objects in Europeana, enabling mash-ups.

The Schema for Integration of Web Applications (SIWA) is a framework that will allow users to apply external services to objects in Europeana. For example, external translation services could be called on to translate a description on a Europeana record from one language to another.
