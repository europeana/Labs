The prototype is a mobile application for art discovery.

It supports tourists seeking local attractions with a database of galleries and museums and a preview of exhibitions available on the go. Also, thanks to geo-localisation and map services, it may also serve as a city guide. Winner in the category 'Developers' Pick' at Hack4Europe '11 - Poland (together with "Institution Recommendations based on Geospatial Data").
