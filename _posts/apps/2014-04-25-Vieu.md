**vieu- europeana cultural heritage visual search** - vieu is a visual search engine focusing on cultural heritage content. Starting from a random set of query suggestions, the user can get a list of matching images ranked by visual similarity. These results are retrieved from a collection of images from Europeana data providers. Along with the results, the user is presented with a direct link to the image page in the Europeana portal.

A number of different visual similarity methods are available using either local or global descriptors, with an easy way of moving back and forth between them for comparison. Depending on the method, the user may also get a graphical representation of how the similarity between the images was determined.

The indexing of the database and the computing of visual similarity and ranking are based on state-of-the-art computer vision methods. The collection contains 422K Europeana images, but the methods employed can support scaling up to millions.
