**EuropeanaConnect Gazetteer** - A rich data resource including over 9m geographic names, co-ordinates, and boundaries.

The EuropeanaConnect Gazetteer is a Geographical Information Service (GIS). This rich data resource gives service providers access to over 9 million geographic names, co-ordinates, and boundaries.

By enriching Europeana&#39;s metadata with these geographic references, it is possible to identify features such as continents, countries, cities, monuments and rivers contained in the objects on Europeana. The service also has a multilingual aspect. Users can search for a single term such as &lsquo;London&#39; and retrieve results for objects marked with &lsquo;Londres&#39; or &lsquo;Londyn&#39;.

Information in the EuropeanaConnect Gazetteer has been collected from free data sources, which means there are no legal constraints to its use and re-use. Information from additional data sources is also continuously integrated, ensuring the service is kept up to date.
