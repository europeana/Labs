**Amsterdam Museum Linked Open Data**- The [Linked Open Data Cloud](http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/) connects items from various domains, including cultural heritage. By using unique web-identifiers (URIs) for objects and a common framework for describing them (RDF), and by linking to existing resources, a web of semantically-linked data emerges.

Europeana&#39;s rich semantic data is also added to this Linked Open Data cloud. We use the Europeana Data Model to describe the rich resources from museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual archives, and then link this data to existing datasets such as [DBpedia](http://www.dbpedia.org/) or [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/)(structured geographical data).

Currently, the complete Amsterdam Museum&#39;s collection is available as Europeana Linked Open Data. As a result, there are now more than 5 million RDF triplets (or &lsquo;facts&#39;) describing over 70,000 cultural heritage objects related to the city of Amsterdam. Links are provided to the [Dutch Art and Architecture Thesaurus](http://www.aat-ned.nl/) (AATNed), [Getty&#39;s Union List of Artists Names](http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/) (ULAN), Geonames and DBpedia, enriching the Amsterdam dataset.

For example: the URI [http://purl.org/collections/nl/am/proxy-63431](http://purl.org/collections/nl/am/proxy-63431) , when opened in a web browser will show an image and descriptive information about this object. An RDF-based application will retrieve the data in a machine-readable format. The data is also accessible through a SPARQL endpoint.
