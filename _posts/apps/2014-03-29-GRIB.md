**Global References Index to Biodiversity (GRIB)** - A collection of bibliographic data from the natural history museums and botanical gardens of Europe and the USA.

This data will be combined to create an index that eventually refers to all of the world&#39;s published biodiversity literature. The location of each item will be included.

The index will also allow users to see if there is a digital copy of the publication. If not, it can be marked for future scanning.

The Global References Index to Biodiversity became operational in February 2011. As it develops, data from places outside of Europe and the USA will be added.

[The European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy](http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/)(EDIT) is developing GRIB, together with [BHL-Europe](http://www.bhl-europe.eu/) and [BHL](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/). It has been built by the Common Library Network [GBV](http://www.gbv.de/vgm/).
