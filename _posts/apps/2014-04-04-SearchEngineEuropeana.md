**Search Engine For Europeana** - A search engine that links data together to enable improved search.

Semantic-searching &ndash; a research prototype created for Europeana by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam[VU.nl](http://www.vu.nl)) &ndash; uses linked data, which gives machines the ability to make associations and put search terms into context.

For example, a search for &lsquo;Paris&#39; intuitively leads to connected concepts such as items in the Louvre, a Paris-based institution, or paintings portraying people named Paris, such as the Greek prince who abducted Helen of Troy. From there, more links point the way to topics like the &lsquo;myth of Paris&#39; or the mythical Apple of Discord - a golden apple that sparked a dispute and eventually led to the Trojan War - and then on to the forbidden apple eaten by Adam and Eve.

The semantic-search engine contains data of the[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam](http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/), the[Mus&eacute;e du Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/) in Paris, and the [Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie](http://website.rkd.nl/) (Netherlands Institute for Art History) in The Hague.

As a work-in-progress, multilingual support for semantic-searching is limited. The prototype&#39;s interface is available in English, French and Dutch.
