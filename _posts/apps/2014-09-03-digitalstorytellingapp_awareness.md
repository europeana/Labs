The Digital Storytelling Protype (DSP) was developed in the Europeana Awareness project by partners [Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision](http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision),
[National Technical University Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html), [Spild af Tid](http://www.spildaftid.dk/) and EEuropeana. It's a service (backend, API and client) that allows users to create and publish collections of content 
mixing their own uploads with existing content in Europeana and on YouTube.
