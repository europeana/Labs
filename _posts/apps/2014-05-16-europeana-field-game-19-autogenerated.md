Winner in the category 'Most innovative app' at Hack4Europe '11 - Poland.

A community driven geotagging of Europeana content. The user can "drag" and pin elements (Europeana items) to a location and see elements pinned to a location by other users. The game encourages geo-tagging by introducing quests and allowing interaction with other users. The geo-tags created by the players can be used later on to suggest interesting Europeana content based on location data.
