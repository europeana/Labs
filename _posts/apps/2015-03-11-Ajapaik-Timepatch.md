Ajapaik (translated from Estonian to English as 'Timepatch') is a location based site inviting users to look around and add metadata to historical images. It also adds a social and competitive element, with points awarded for contributions made.

Ajapaik was a winner in the Europeana Creative Challenges and will be working to create location focussed challenges using carefully sourced imagery from Europeana. As a first step, [a selection of early images of Paris](http://ajapaik.ee/game/?album=23) have been added to coincide with the Europeana Tech conference held in the city in February 2015.
