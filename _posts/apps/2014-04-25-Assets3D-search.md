**Disclaimer** This tool or prototype was developed in the context of a research project. We can't ensure the permanent availability of the demos online. 

**ASSETS 3D search** - The ASSETS 3D search demo allows users to search for 3D models that are similar to a returned search query. In this demonstrator, users can search among 300 3D models from the Google 3D Warehouse using one model as a template for finding other models similar to it. This is made possible by analysing and indexing the shape of each 3D model and using the index as a basis for search.

From a technical perspective, the similarity between the 3D models is based on a view-based, low-level feature extraction algorithm, designed and implemented by CERTH-ITI ([www.iti.gr](http://www.iti.gr/)). The indexing is developed by ISTI-CNR ([http://www.isti.cnr.it/](www.isti.cnr.it)) and is an inverted file-based indexing. This indexing method is highly scalable and will support the indexing of thousands of 3D models.

The 3D Search &amp; Retrieval task in ASSETS is still in progress. In future versions of this demo, the user will be able to upload their own 3D models and search for similar ones or draw sketches to try to find matching models.
