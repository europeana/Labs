[Europeana Remix](http://remix.europeana.eu/ "Europeana Remix") is an interactive platform based on the film 'Otto & Bernard'. This short film was produced for the project [Europeana 1914-1918](http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/ "Europeana 1914-1918"), encouraging families to share photos, letters and memorabilia of World War I. Now, the film forms the basis of the Remix initiative, combining cutting-edge technology ([Popcorn.js](http://popcornjs.org/ "Popcorn"), the [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "Link to HTML5-article on Wikipedia") video framework) and a variety of resources from Europeana (via the API) and across the web.

Europeana Remix was developed in cooperation with [Kennisland](http://www.knowledgeland.org/ "Link to the Kennisland website"), [Three Eyed Labs](http://www.chirls.com/ "Link to the Three Eyed Labs website"), and [BigUp](http://werk.bigup.nl/ "Link to the BigUp website").
