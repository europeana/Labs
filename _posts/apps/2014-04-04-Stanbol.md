**Stanbol**- The [Apache Stanbol](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/) project was initiated by the European R&amp;D project IKS(http://www.iks-project) (Interactive Knowledge Stack).

Stanbol is designed to provide semantic services for existing content management systems. It o ffers the&nbsp;following features:</p>

* **Content enhancement** services that add semantic information to &lsquo;non-semantic&#39; pieces of content.
* **Reasoning** services that produce additional semantic information about the content based on the data retrieved via content enhancement.
* **Knowledge model** services that are used to define and manipulate the data models (e.g., ontologies) for storing the semantic information.
* **Persistence services that store (or cache) semantic data (enhanced content, entities, facts) and make it searchable.

See more information on the [technical details](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/presentations/www2012-Automated_Linking_Data_with_Apache_Stanbol_rwesten.pdf")

Two prototypes using the Europeana data are available
	*Note: we recommend the use of Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome to view the demos*

===Enhancement Chains===

To use this demo, enter some texts in the Stanbol Enhancer input frame. The text will be linked with the labels of pictures available from the Austrian National Library (ONB). The linking is based on the dataset from the ONB available in the [Europeana Linked Open Data pilot](http://data.europeana.eu).

Note that the demo only works with German text. As examples you can use the following texts:

* [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strau%C3%9F_%28Sohn%29](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strau%C3%9F_%28Sohn%29)
* [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Aussee](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Aussee)

===Hallo===
	
The Hallo tool has been developed by the team responsible for[VIE](http://viejs.org/)(Vienna IKS Editables &ndash; a Java library). This demo uses text written in a HTML5 Rich Text Editor, where users can accept suggested annotations, triggering the insertion of pictures below the editable region.

You first have to click on the text and then on the &lsquo;annotate&#39; icon. Click on one of the underlined word and choose your reference from Europeana. The image selected will bring you to the corresponding record on[http://www.europeana.eu](http://www.europeana.eu/portal).
