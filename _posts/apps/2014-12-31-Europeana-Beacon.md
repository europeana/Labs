Europeana Beacon was the winner of the [Apps for Europe](http://www.appsforeurope.eu/) award at [Hack4Pisa](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hack4pisa-registration-12152387117), October 2014.

The Europeana Beacon (eBe) iOS App is a new way of thinking about tourist guides. It puts a real-time, proximity driven system right into the hands of users, leveraging the potential of iBeacons technology with the Europeana's extensive database. By placing a beacon near a specific point of interest, the app can determine the user position in a town square as well as in a museum room or large exhibit, always displaying the correct information about the work of art they’re facing. Users can discover new facts, engage in fun puzzles and quizzes to explore the surroundings, while museum curators or the local tourism bureau can have a deep insight about what people really visited.
