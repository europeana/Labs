The project provides a unique visual experience, featuring personal World War One stories collected across Europe as part of Europeana's 1914-18 Family History Roadshows.

The installation enables the browsing and display of multiple items of web content simultaneously in a public exhibition setting. Using the Europeana API, high-resolution content and the semantic relationships in the existing metadata, it shows a dynamic amalgamation of personal stories, associated image clouds and soundscape on an interactive 3D 9m x 3m video wall.

Europeana eCloud is a collaboration between Europeana, City University Hong Kong's Applied Laboratory for Interactive Visualization and Embodiment, Australia's Museum Victoria and ProjectionDesign. It was presented during the Europeana Awareness Day in Brussels in May 2012 and the Europeana Plenary in Leuven in June 2012. The eCloud software can easily be adapted to create installations based on themes other than the First World War.
