The aim of the Europeana Creative Design Challenge is to engage designers, artists, developers and entrepreneurs to explore and experiment with with cultural heritage content available in Europeana. We challenge ingenious minds and makers to rethink and redesign our common culture, and produce innovative and novel interpretations that make use of digital cultural content and data sourced from Europeana. 

The challenge opened on the 30th October 2014 and online submissions are welcome until 18th January, 2015
