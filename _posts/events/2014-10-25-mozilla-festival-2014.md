Redesign Your Cultural Heritage! is taking place at the [Mozilla Festival](http://2014.mozillafestival.org/) as a part of the [Art & Culture on the Web track](http://mozfestartoftheweb.tumblr.com/).

Facilitators: Sanna Marttila, Neea Laakso, Kati Hyyppä (Aalto University), Christina Holm (Spild af Tid ApS), James Morley (Europeana)

The aim of the Redesign Your Cultural Heritage! session is to connect the digital cultural heritage offered by Europeana to communities of designers and artists who wish to use open cultural content - data, pictures, sound, videos -  as inspiration and sources for new derivative works, such as animations and films, media art and installations, textile patterns, and other design artefacts. 

In this hands-on session the facilitators guide you through making of open cultural works on specific themes and introduce participants to digital and open cultural heritage online. Participants can also work on their own and build upon the materials and digital cultural heritage content gathered and provided by the session. The aim is to facilitate creative reuse of cultural heritage content in multiple levels and accommodate various skills of participants - both more experienced and beginner open culture hackers.

The session is hosted and organized by the [Europeana Creative project](http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/home), and is using the Europeana platform to access digital open cultural heritage.

Below is a rough schedule for the session to give some idea of the day’s program, but feel free to join in at any point!
