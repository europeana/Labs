Apps&Cultura has teamed up with Europeana Creative for this year’s Hack at Home competition, an exciting new European project which enables and promotes greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by Europe’s creative industries.  By using the Europeana API we want to encourage people to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage in innovative and creative ways! We’re currently looking for innovative applications that re-use Europeana content on the themes of Tourism & Social Networks.

The team from Europeana will be organising a hands on workshop demonstrating how to use the Europeana API and include it in your applications. If you have an idea for a great application but are a little overwhelmed by what Europeana content you could use, how to access it, or maybe the usage restrictions then this is the workshop for you!

### Agenda
Wednesday 16 July 2014
- Welcome & Introduction (17.00 - 17.20)
- Showcasing Europeana content (17.20 - 17.30)
- Barcelona specific datasets (17.30 – 18.00)
- Europeana Api (18.00 – 18.20)
- Questions & Answers (18.20 - 18.45)
- Networking (18.45-20.00)

Before the workshop, why not explore [Europeana Labs](/) so you can familiarise yourself with what is currently available and come prepared with questions relating to the Europeana API & specific data sets you’re looking for. 

If you have any questions relating to the [second round of challenges on Tourism & Social Networks](http://ecreativechallenges2014.istart.org/) this will be a great opportunity for you to ask and receive feedback/support!
 
The event will also be web streamed and recorded so if you can’t make it to Barcelona on the day you’ll be able to watch online or catch up after the event. Webstreaming link coming soon so check back here or catch us on Twitter [@eCreativeEU](https://twitter.com/eCreativeEU) for the latest info & link.
