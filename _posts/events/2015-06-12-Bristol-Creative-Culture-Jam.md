Participants will be supported and collaborate with a team associates ranging from designers, programmers and artists throughout the day to re-use local and Europeana digital heritage in a new and innovative way.

Young people will work in small teams to generate and present their ideas, then bring those closer to reality by creating prototypes including wireframes, app designs, modelling and sculpture, lasercut designs, 3D printed objects and more. One young person will be selected as an ambassador to represent the Bristol Jam in the final Culture Jam in Austria in July.

If you know a young person who likes making new friends, is either creative, into arts or digital technology then send them to us!
