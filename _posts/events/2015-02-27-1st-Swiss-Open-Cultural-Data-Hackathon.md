The event is organised by the OpenGLAM.ch working group and invites software developers, researchers and domain experts interested in using cultural data, data providers, designers, and idea providers for two creative days at the Swiss National Library in Bern. The thematic focus of the hackathon will be on using cultural heritage data/content online for research purposes in Digital Humanities and related areas, as well as in the context of Wikipedia and Wikimedia. Participants are welcome to re-use the open data/open content provided for other purposes, such as the development of apps or artistic re-mixes.
