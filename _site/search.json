To perform general API calls, like search, object or provider/collection, which do not involve user-specific information, the most basic authentication scheme is used. For accessing user-specific data stored on MyEuropeana accounts using MyData calls, a caller application is to be identified by the user credentials. Finally, for applications wishing to get 3rd party access on behalf of a registered user, OAuth2 authentication scheme is supported. This is the simplest form of authentication which does not involve accessing user-specific information. To perform a call using this authentication every API call must be provided a special authentication parameter wskey. This value of this parameter should be the private key that you got during the API user registration process. We use these keys to anonymously gather interesting statistics about API usage. This form of authentication is used when an application wishes to access MyEuropeana data of a specific user and the public and the private keys of this user are known available in advance. In this case login is done by calling a POST method with the following two parameters that contain authentication credentials: When a login is successful a status 200 is returned, otherwise a redirect to the login page is triggered.  For applications that wish to access MyEuropeana data of a specific end-user on his behalf, we use the standard OAuth2 authentication scheme. This scheme works by redirecting the application to a dedicated login page provided by the server and issuing to the application an authenticating token with a limited lifetime when the login is succesful. The token can be refreshed later on by the application. To use this kind of authentication the application should first access the URL and further on the URL to refresh the token. There are many open source libraries available for various languages to help you implement this authentication scheme in your project.

The API uses the standard web technology of REST calls over HTTP. Responses are returned in the popular JSON format. To get straight to the point of the API, you can go directly to the Getting Started page which tells you only what you have to know to start using the API. To start using the API you should register at the registration page. Upon registration you will get your individual private authentication key. This key should be used when calling API methods as a special wskey authentication parameter. The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backward compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developers to switch to the new naming of the fields that were used in API1. For more information on the mapping between the new and the old fields, please see API1-API2 Fields Mapping. There is a method for developers to see how Europeana API works and test it for their needs without getting registered - the API console. This is an interactive tool that allows filling method parameters in an online form and see both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by an application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developers’ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community.

Advanced users are encouraged to use Lucene and Apache SOLR guides to get most out of the Europeana repository. For others, we supply a basic guide for querying Europeana. To look for records that contain a search term in one of the data fields, provide the term as a query parameter: Note that like in many other search applications omitting the quotes will result in searching for records that contain the term Mona or the term Lisa but not necessarily both of them. If you want to limit your search to a specific data field you should provide the name of the field using the following syntax. For example, to look for objects whose creator is Leonardo da Vinci: To combine several fields in one search one can use boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT (note the case-sensitivity). Use parentheses to group logical conditions. Note that two consecutive terms without any boolean operator in between default to the AND operator. Boolean operators can also be combined with the search by fields. The following example searches for objects whose location is in Paris or in London: The boolean NOT operator cannot be used alone but only in conjunction with another boolean operator. For example, looking for objects which contain the term Lisa but do not contain the term Mona is done by the following: So far we dealt with examples where there was only one query term. Sometimes it is useful to split a query into a variable and a constant part. For instance, for an application that accesses only objects located in London, it is possible to have the constant part of the query pre-selecting London-based objects and the variable part selecting objects within this pre-selection. This can be done using the refinement parameter qf which is appended to the query parameter. This example looks for objects which contain the term Westminster and their location is in London: Refinement parameters can be concatenated. Each such parameter and the mandatory query parameter contributes a breadcrumb object if breadcrumbs are specified in the search profile. Querying by facets is also done using the refinement parameter qf. The following example looks for objects containing the term Paris among images: Here are more examples of faceted search.

A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive documentation on Europeana website. However, a basic understanding of the data organization is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding. The Europeana API provides access to the Europeana data, which is modeled using EDM. While EDM is an open flexible data model featuring various kind of resources and relations between them, the Europeana API (and the Europeana Portal) supports the retrieval of a segment of EDM for practical purposes (a subgraph, to use strict terminology). These ‘atomic’ EDM segments usually contain one Cultural Heritage Object (CHO), the aggregation information which connects the metadata and the digital representations together and a number of contextual resources such as the agents, places, concepts and time pertaining to the CHO. The further API documentation, in particular the /record call refers to this subgraph as object.  Digital records delivered to Europeana are assigned a unique identifier, Europeana ID, that serves to further identify the records when using the API. Usually, this identifier is based on the original metadata that are provided for the record and internal Europeana identifiers of the provider and the dataset containing the record. For example, a Europeana ID of an object can look as follows: where 091 is the identifier of the provider, 02 is the id of the dataset and GNM_1234 is derived from the unique identifier of the record in the context of the provider. Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each object is described by a number of fields in the record which contain information such as the title of the object, its description, the date, persons and concepts related to it. Europeana aggregates its data from cultural institutions that can use diverse, fine-grained systems and methodologies. As a result, a link between for example an object and a person may be stored in different specialized fields. To provide simpler views on this data, Europeana has introduced several general Aggregated Fields: title, who, what, when, and where. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier. Title, for example, aggregates data from the dc:title and dcterms:alternative fields which are part of Dublin Core, a popular general standard for describing different types of resources. The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient ways to allow our users to discover what they need easily. One such technique is a faceted indexing system that classifies each record along multiple dimensions. The facets, seen on the left side of the Europeana portal, can be useful for filtering search results and can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets:","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":"How Europeana data hierarchy is organized"},{"title":"API Data Fields","url":"/api/data-fields/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Each Europeana field has different names in different contexts.

It assumes that the reader has extensive knowledge of Linked Data technology. The project has also been described in the technical paper presented at the Dublin Core 2011 conference. Disclaimer: Many aspects documented in this page are experimental and thus remain open for discussion and change.  The Europeana Data Model was designed to replace the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE). EDM is now gradually making Europeana fit within a networked data environment. It is a much more flexible and precise model than ESE, and offers the opportunity to attach every statement to the specific resource it applies to, and to reflect some basic form of data provenance. The main EDM requirements include: distinguishing between a 'provided item' (painting, book) and its digital representations distinguishing between an item and the metadata record describing it allowing the ingestion of multiple records for the same item, which may contain contradictory statements about it As a consequence of EDM having to meet these requirements, EDM data has a level of complexity above that which Europeana currently maintains. This level of complexity is comparable to what can be found in the data of many Europeana providers, and thus, we argue, it enables better exploitation of that data. Note also that, as much as possible, EDM re-uses elements coming from already-established vocabularies, such as Dublin Core, OAI-ORE, SKOS and CIDOC-CRM, thus lowering the cost of its creation and, hopefully, its adoption.</p> For more information on EDM, we refer to the EDM Definitions and EDM Primer on Europeana's technical documents page. The EDM OWL ontology is accessible through content negotiation but it is also directly available. Please be aware that both data.europeana.eu and those documents are under constant revision. There could therefore be some (minor) discrepancies between them! The data available in the pilot results from a conversion of legacy ESE data into EDM. This entails creating resources for the main EDM classes, and distributing ESE metadata fields over these various resources, as presented in this mapping. The resulting data does not realise the full potential offered by EDM but it allows us to make some distinctions, which we believe are useful for data consumers. Additionally, data.europeana.eu includes semantic connections to external (linked data) sources. We serve links to other linked data services already maintained by Europeana providers - currently only the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator (SOCH). The vast majority of external links come from semantic enrichment realised at the Europeana Office, connecting Europeana items to places (as provided by GeoNames), concepts (from the GEMET thesaurus), persons (from DBpedia) and time periods (from an adhoc time period vocabulary).  The core EDM classes, together with the properties we expect to be applied to their instances, are presented in these templates. Of course it is unrealistic that all of those properties would be available for any single object exposed in Europeana. This is especially true for items that are described using the simple legacy ESE format. In particular, Europeana does not currently harvest any description for contextual entities, such as concepts, agents and places. Still, the ESE data harvested from Europeana providers, as well as the enrichment work by Europeana, allows us to create and describe a network of EDM resources for every Europeana object, as shown in this big picture example. The following explains in more detail the data that can be found for every class of resource served by data.europeana.eu: Item (Provided Cultural Heritage Object): Item resources represent objects (painting, book, etc.) for which institutions provide digital representations to be accessed through Europeana. Provided Cultural Heritage Object (CHO) URIs (for example,  http://data.europeana.eu/item/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03, (raw data) are the main entry points in data.europeana.eu. A provided CHO is the hub of the network of relevant resources (cf. below). When applicable, the Europeana URIs for these objects also link, via 'owl:sameAs' statements, to other linked data resources about the same object, for example this item (raw data). In this Linked Data pilot, no descriptive metadata (creator, subject, etc.) is directly attached to item URIs. It is instead attached to the proxies that represent a view of the object, from a specific institution's perspective (either a Europeana provider or Europeana itself). Depending on the feedback received during this pilot, we may change this and duplicate all the descriptive metadata at the level of the item URI. Such an option is costly in terms of data verbosity, but it would enable easier access to metadata for data consumers less concerned about provenance.  Provider's proxy: These resources (for example, [http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03] (http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03); (raw data) are used as subjects of descriptive statements (creator, subject, date of creation, etc.) for the item, which are contributed by a Europeana provider. In the OAI-ORE model, proxies enable the separation of different views for the same resource, in the context of different aggregations. This allows us to distinguish the original metadata for the object from the metadata that is created by Europeana, an important requirement for us. Descriptive properties that apply to these proxies mostly come from Dublin Core : view an example. Proxies are connected to the item they represent a facet of using the 'ore:proxyFor' property. They are attached to the aggregation that contextualises them using 'ore:proxyIn'. Note to the reader: given the lack of support for named graphs (aka 'quadruples') in the RDF standard, ORE introduced proxies in order to support referencing resources in the context of a graph. Eventually, named graphs may be natively supported by RDF, which would lead to obsolescence of the proxy construct.  Provider's aggregation: These resources (e.g., http://data.europeana.eu/aggregation/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) provide data related to a Europeana provider's gathering of digitised representations and descriptive metadata for an item. As shown in this data, they are related to digital resources about the item, be they files directly representing it ('edm:object' and 'edm:isShownBy') or webpages showing the object in context ('edm:isShownAt'). They may also provide controlled rights information applying to these resources ('edm:rights'). Other statements provided in the same ESE record as the descriptive metadata for the item – but that do not always clearly apply to it – are also attached to aggregations. Finally, provenance data is given in statements using 'edm:provider' (the direct provider to Europeana in the data aggregation chain) or 'edm:dataProvider' (the cultural institution that curates the object). The aggregation is connected to the item resource using the 'edm:aggregatedCHO' property.  Europeana's proxy: The second type of proxies served at data.europeana.eu. are Europeana proxies (e.g., http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) which provide access to the metadata created by Europeana for a given item, distinct from the metadata provided by the provider. Here one can find 'edm:year' statements, indicating a normalised date associated with the object. We also serve millions of generic 'edm:hasMet' enrichments, created by Europeana from a range of ESE descriptive fields (read documentation). These statements connect a Europeana proxy to places from GeoNames, concepts from the GEMET thesaurus, persons from DBpedia and periods from an adhoc time vocabulary. Finally, a proxy is connected to the item it represents a facet of, using the 'ore:proxyFor' property, as well as to the aggregation</a> that contextualises it, using 'ore:proxyIn'.  Europeana's aggregation: a Europeana aggregation (for example, http://data.europeana.eu/aggregation/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03, (raw data) bundles together the result of all data creation and aggregation efforts for a given item. It aggregates the provider's aggregation (using ore:aggregates), which in turn will connect to the provider's proxy. Next to the provider aggregation, one can find the digitised resources Europeana.eu serves for the item, i.e., an object page ('edm:landingPage') and a thumbnail (using a combination of 'edm:hasView' and 'foaf:thumbnail'). The Europeana proxy is also connected to this aggregation, as mentioned above.  Resource map: OAI-ORE Resource maps are constructs for indicating meta-level statements about the creation and publication of ORE data (ORE aggregations and their aggregated resources). We are exploring their use as a contextualisation mechanism for the Europeana aggregation. Maps (for example, http://data.europeana.eu/rm/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) are connected to an item they are about using 'foaf:primaryTopic', and to its corresponding Europeana aggregation using 'ore:describes'. They sum up the provenance of data using 'dc:creator' and 'dc:contributor' statements. Crucially, they also indicate, in a machine-readable way, that the (RDF) data served at data.europeana.eu is provided under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

Linked Data offers many opportunities to the cultural sector, as suggested in the recent reports from the W3C Library Linked Data incubator group and our own animation. Releasing Europeana metadata as Linked Open Data is an important step for Europeana, its partners and third parties. Linked Open Data has a key role in the Europeana Strategic Plan 2011-2015  and supports the idea that Europeana ‘distributes’ content and ‘engages’ its users: Distribute: the pilot will allow Europeana to distribute the cultural heritage content, in order to ‘Make their heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it’. Engage: it will also enhance the engagement of the different communities represented by Europeana’s content by allowing re-use and connectivity. First, Linked Data is a publishing technique that enables related data to be connected and makes it easily accessible using common Web technologies. See this White Paper for further discussion on the scientific interest of Linked Data for the Europeana community. Second, Linked Open Data realises this in an open manner, where everyone can access, re-use, enrich and share the data published. See this business document for further explanation on why Europeana and its partners should open the metadata they gather from all around Europe, and the Support for open data section of our site for general information on Europeana’s efforts. You may also be interested in this paper at Museum & the Web that gives interesting context and pointers to current Linked Open Data developments. The data served by data.europeana.eu is generated from the metadata Europeana has harvested using the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE)(http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements). To make this data amenable to Linked Data publishing, we have converted it to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, and structured it using the Europeana Data Model. We give more detail on the EDM data we publish on the Data Structure page. In addition to the original data harvested by Europeana from its data providers, the data served at data.europeana.eu includes: links to other Linked Open Data services which hold information about objects that are also served by data.europeana.eu: for the moment this only concerns the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator (SOCH) semantic enrichment done at the Europeana Office, connecting Europeana objects to structured representations of places (using GeoNames, concepts (using the GEMET thesaurus), people (using DBpedia) and time periods(from an adhoc time period vocabulary). As this project is about engaging users from different communities, we've made sure that data from the pilot can be accessed, re-used, enriched and shared by everyone. data.europeana.eu is serving metadata following the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. File dumps of the RDF data are available on the data downloads</a> page. You can also fetch a subset of this data over the HTTP protocol, using established Linked Data recipes, most notably the use of HTTP URIs as identifiers and entry points into data.

We also provide the datasets as file dumps of the RDF data at data downloads page. If you are a Europeana data provider, you don't need to submit your data again to Europeana. Once the Data Exchange Agreement (DEA) has been signed, we just fetch the metadata Europeana has already gathered.

It only makes sense to annotate full-scale images (maps), and full-length audio tracks or videos. Currently, Europeana does not have full access to most objects. 2.

The image annotation interface allows the user to annotate full-scale images; it is based on the Google Web Toolkit. The map annotation interface is a special variant of the image annotation one. It adds a number of several Geographic Information System (GIS) related features and uses tiled full-scale images, which allows for a user experience similar to that of services like Google Maps. The audio and video components of the EuropeanaConnect Annotation Suite use a modified Flash player. The audio annotation tool only allows for the annotation of time segments of an audio track or its entirety, while the video annotation tool adds features that are similar to those of the image annotation tool.

Users first model their source data according to the classes and properties defined in the ontology of their choice using a graphical user interface. Karma learns (through learning techniques, Steiner tree) to recognise the mapping of the data to the ontology and then uses the ontology to suggest semantic types and relationships between them. Users can then adjust the mapping by suggesting new relationships. Users can preview the results of the mapping and also assess the quality of the semantic links that have been created by the tool.

The linked dataset is now ready for use by Irish information professionals in the library, museum and archives domains. The project was undertaken collaboratively by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI), INSIGHT@NUIGalway (formerly the Digital Enterprise Research Institute), Fiontar at Dublin City University, the National Library of Ireland and the Placenames Branch of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of the Irish Government. As well as transforming the geographic Logainm dataset to Linked Data, the project team also developed the demonstrator website Location LODer. Location LODer is built on the Linked Logainm dataset and a map interface, allowing users to explore content and digital resources relating to locations across Ireland. Selecting a place name on the map loads the available content, sourced from logainm.ie, DBpedia, the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Maps collection, the Irish Historic Towns Atlas project and Europeana. Location LODer aims to demonstrate how Linked Data technologies can enhance the catalogues of Irish cultural institutions. Location LODer gathers information using different SPARQL and Linked Open Data endpoints where available - namely Europeana and DBpedia. The Europeana SPARQL endpoint available at http://europeana.ontotext.com/sparql is used to retrieve objects that might relate to Irish place names. When a specific place name is selected in Location LODer, the Europeana SPARQL endpoint is queried for any objects that contain both the selected place name and its county name as a ‘dc:subject’ and a ‘spatial’ property of ‘Ireland’. Results are retrieved in JSON format to be rendered in the appropriate section of the website. A similar approach is applied to the DBpedia endpoint at http://dbpedia.org/sparql/, however for this endpoint we rely on previously determined links that are included in the Logainm dataset. The MARC records for the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Map Collection were enhanced to include links to the newly created Linked Logainm URIs, and this information is used to retrieve the maps relevant to the place name the user has selected. A short presentation on the process of creating the Linked Logainm dataset and the enhancing of the MARC records was presented at the First Workshop on Linking and Contextualizing Publications and Datasets (presentation is available at http://www.slideshare.net/nunoalexandrelopes/presentation-26782239”). The dataset is available at http://data.logainm.ie/sparql, and the demonstrator Location LODer is at http://apps.dri.ie/locationLODer/.","tags":["Linked Open Data"],"imageurl":"/img/apps/Linked-Logainm/Image of the website.png","excerpt":"<p><strong>Europeana Linked Open Data feeds Irish place name database</strong></p>\n\n"},{"title":"MIMO-VOC - A multilingual vocabulary management tool","url":"/apps/MIMO-VOC","date":"2014-03-29 00:00:00 +0100","categories":["apps"],"body":"MIMO-VOC: A multilingual vocabulary management tool - This tool was developed as part of the MIMO Project(Musical Instrument Museums Online).

Last year we consulted with the developer community asking them what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana APIs. This Europeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June. We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. This is backed up by a revamp of the API documentation, providing everything you should need to exploit the full potential of the Europeana platform and get creative with the content. But wherever you are, whatever your skills, and no matter what you’re planning, don’t be afraid to ask for help as we’re here to support you. Once you have an idea and you want to start building your application, head to our comprehensive online documentation. It covers both the REST API and Linked Open Data, with extensive examples illustrating methods, syntax, and responses. You can also use the API Console to build and test anything from the simplest search to a complex query using facets such as dates, geotags and permissions. Even if you’re new to Europeana, getting started is simple. 1. Register for an API key 2. Use the API Console to explore the content and customise queries. If you need help, check out the example Datasets and consult our extensive API documentation. 3. Build your application. If you don’t know where to start, find inspiration in the Application Gallery - many applications have public code repositories and there’s also a Java library and Python wrapper available. There are lots of ways you can get help with using the Europeana APIs. Contact us directly via our contact form or at api@europeana.eu. If you want to chat with fellow developers head over to the API Forum on Google Groups and you can also follow @EuropeanaTech on Twitter.

The user can annotate an object using a resource as a whole (e.g. an image) or by using only a part of this resource (e.g. few minutes of a video). Once an object has been completely annotated, the user can play the different media in parallel and start comparison work. The users can play several related annotations, creating their own story by navigating among them. The stories are personal experiences that can be shared among users.

Pundit not only enables users to annotate Web pages in various ways (comments, citations, boo kmarks…) but also to convert these annotations into semantically structured data that can be later integrated to the “Semantic Web”. The framework to represent the annotations is based on the Open Annotation model. The ability to express semantic relationships between resources relies on the use of ontologies and vocabularies (such as Freebase.com and Dbpedia.org) that can be configured according to the needs of the communities using Pundit. The re-use of resources already available on the web provides solutions to multilinguality or disambiguation related challenges. In Pundit each annotation is described by data structured in RDF which connects the annotated object (a manuscript, a video…) to other objects or entities available as Linked Data. Semantic relationships based on URIs are created between the different entities identified in a given web page. Pundit stores annotations on an RDF based server which exposes APIs to consume annotations along with their structured content. Pundit is also a collaborative platform which allows users to team up during the annotation creation process, to share their results and also re-use annotations created by other users. It therefore participates in the dialogue between scholars and in the creation of new knowledge. For more technical details on Pundit, see http://www.thepund.it/publications/.

This is made possible by analysing and indexing the shape of each 3D model and using the index as a basis for search. From a technical perspective, the similarity between the 3D models is based on a view-based, low-level feature extraction algorithm, designed and implemented by CERTH-ITI (www.iti.gr). The indexing is developed by ISTI-CNR (http://www.isti.cnr.it/) and is an inverted file-based indexing. This indexing method is highly scalable and will support the indexing of thousands of 3D models. The 3D Search & Retrieval task in ASSETS is still in progress. In future versions of this demo, the user will be able to upload their own 3D models and search for similar ones or draw sketches to try to find matching models.

The Linked Open Graph allows users to see, explore and browse the relationships among the ECLAP content and other types of resource created on the ECLAP platform. These resources consist of: Information about the creator of the resource (i.e. the creator of the content or the user who uploaded the content) Taxonomies: each piece of content is associated with a term from the ECLAP Classification system. Groups and thus content providers and thematic groups in ECLAP. Collections: users have the possibility to create collections by using the ECLAP content. Annotations: Users can create annotations on the ECLAP platform thanks to the MyStory Player tool Publications: to connect user that published the content Related objects: objects that are similar according to the current ECLAP metric used among similar by text and similar by content Location: associated locations identified as Linked Open Data viaGeonames, allowing the navigation into the structure of the structure of the Geonames entities And other resources related to social media such as comments, favourites … These resources are organised as a RDF graph where each resource is represented by a node. The relationships between the nodes are also represented in the graph and the user can navigate in the graph deciding of expanding each node or putting at the center of the navigation the node he prefers. The Linked Data Graph is featured in association with a media player displaying or playing the content which give rise to the graph. It can be easily used ad general tools for navigating in Linked Open Data, such as DBpedia: http://log.disit.org/service/ as well as visualising Europeana 's content as Linked Open Data : (Try here). The Linked Open Graph visualizer has the potential to be embedded into any web pages. The Social Graph is a simplified version of the Linked Open Graph for social networks. It proposes a new approach for navigation within content and related resources and also improves social interaction between users of the ECLAP platform.

PATHS – enable users to follow pathways (or narratives) published by other users. Users can follow a path from beginning to end or they can leave the path at any time by following recommendations and links. Users who are logged in to the system can save items to their workspace and then create, edit, publish and share pathways. SEARCH – supports discovery of both collection items and paths through keyword search. EXPLORE – enables users to explore the collections using tools which are being designed to appeal to different user preferences. The thesaurus, tags and map tools are designed to appeal to different user preferences for accessing information.  As users drill down, each displays the same range of content using a different visualisation technique. The demonstrator has been built using test data provided by Europeana. It includes around 2 million content items from Spain and the UK.

This is an extract from a blog post previously published by Péter Király, software developer at Europeana. To read the full article visit http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana One of Europeana’s important aims is to make the rights statements of records clear and straightforward. You can imagine, our >2,400 partners have different approaches for licensing their objects, and right now in the database we have 60+ different licence types, in other words the RIGHTS facet has 60+ individual values. Some of them are language or version variations of the same CC licence. Most users don’t want to select from that range of options. But we can categorize these rights statements under 3 main categories: In Europeana we use Apache Solr for searching. Our data model is called EDM (Europeana Data Model), which has almost 200 fields. We also have special fields for facets and we have some aggregated fields. What we wanted to achieve was to form a new facet from these options, but the most straightforward solution, i.e. to create a new field in Solr, was not an easily implementable option because it would require a full reindexing (it would be another blog entry to explain why that was not possible), so we had to search for another solution. To count the numbers belonging to the individual rights statements in the RIGHTS facet would work, but that’s only good for displaying, and it doesn’t cover the problem of user interaction. To use the RIGHTS field for search turned out to be risky because it interferes with the RIGHTS facet, so that did not worked either. Finally we come up with a fake facet, which has two sides: one on the display side, and one on the search side. To count the numbers we use a special Solr facet type: query facet. It is a simple, but at the same time a powerful solution. It doesn’t give you a list of existing field values, as a normal facet. In the query facet the input is a query, and the returning value is a single number, which tells you how many records fit the combination of the main query and the query specified in the facet’s parameter. Since we don’t need to know the list of items in the categories, that’s enough for us. We defined three queries: On the Europeana portal we use a fake facet called ”REUSABILITY”, and we use it in our filtering parameter (&qf) as REUSABILITY:open, or REUSABILITY:restricted or REUSABILITY:permission. These are shortcuts for the lengthy queries. We keep the interface (and the URL) clean. Explore this on the Portal: europeana.eu In the API we introduced the ”reusability” parameter with the same options as in the portal: “open”, “restricted” and “permission”. Example API call: http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=%5BYOUR%20API%20KEY%5D&query=%3A&reusability=open Explore this in the API console: labs.europeana.eu/api/console/ For details of how this is implemented, including the actual Solr queries, read my original blog post at http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana For more information about the Europeana Data Model see http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation To find out more about the Europeana API check the extensive online documentation section at http://labs.europeana.eu/api/ Péter Király, April 2014http://nl.linkedin.com/in/peterkiraly/","tags":["Re-use","Rights","Facets"],"imageurl":"/img/blog/2014-04-25-Can-I-use-it.png","excerpt":"<p>Uncovering the technology behind the simple search tool to discover reusable content available in both the Europeana  portal and API.</p>\n\n"},{"title":"Coding Da Vinci","url":"/events/Coding_DaVinci","date":"2014-04-26 00:00:00 +0200","categories":["events"],"body":"The hackathon is organised by the German Digital Library, Digital Service Center Berlin, Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and Wikimedia Germany.
