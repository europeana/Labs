Europeana API and Europeana visual data. The Europeana API proved to be easy to use and provides access to over 14 million images, which made it perfect for a very visual application and has the added advantage of being able to connect the user to both famous and obscure collections and sources. Searches for a specific keyword result in a ‘visual river’ of related Europeana images. Clicking on an image leads to the object’s page on the Europeana portal, without losing the initial position in the visual stream. Searches can be linked by using keywords in the URL, e.g. this example allowing themed image streams to be shared. A newer version called Culture Collage plugs in a few more collections APIs and adds a ‘scrapbook’ feature that allows users to bookmark items with one mouse-click and without interrupting the stream.","tags":["API Implementation"],"imageurl":"/img/gallery/europeana-culture-collage/Culture_Collage.jpg","excerpt":"<p>Europeana Culture Collage is developed by Monique Szpak (@zenlan) and started as a simple exercise in mashing up a few of the new web technologies, incl.
