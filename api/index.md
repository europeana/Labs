## Introduction
We currently offer two APIs for use. The first is a REST-API that is suited for dynamic search and retrieval of our data. This API offers exactly the same data as the Europeana Portal for end-users and in many ways the Portal can be viewed as an advanced API-implementation.

The second API is more experimental and supports download of complete datasets and advanced semantic search and retrieval of our data via the SPARQL query language. The Linked Open Data Downloads and SPARQL-endpoint currently includes only a sub-set of all Europeana data, about 20 million of the in-total nearly 31 millions records. We're working on changing that situation and ensure the Linked Open Data service is always up to date.

|API|Usage|
|:-------------|:-------------|
|[REST API](/api/portal-api)| Standard REST calls over HTTP. Responses returned in JSON. |
|[Linked Open Data](/api/linked-open-data/introduction) | Query and retrieve data in SPARQL 1.1. |
