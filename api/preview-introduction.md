This part of our documentation reflects a preview version of the Europeana REST API. This is an upcoming version of our API and can be used to preview and play with new API functionality. Please have a look at our [changelog](/api/preview-changelog/) for a list of all new features and API changes.

### Registration

For the preview API you can use the same API key as you would use for the normal version of the API.

### Data

The preview API works with a dataset of the Europeana data that is 1-3 months behind on the data you can find on the Europeana portal.

### API Console

The API console is currently not compatible with the API preview version.

### Discussion

Join the [Europeana API discussion group at Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi) and get regular updates about the Europeana API, provide feedback and discuss it with other developers.
